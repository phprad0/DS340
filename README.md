We decided to go for a research article titled "A Movie Recommender System: MOVREC using Machine Learning Techniques" for our first parent paper. 

We have uploaded the Jupyter Notebook, the running python file, the datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset?resource=download&select=rating.csv) 
and movies.csv, both taken from Kaggle. We could only upload the csv file to movies as ratings.csv was too large for Github to upload it. 

We have uploaded our selected first parent paper as a PDF file as well.
